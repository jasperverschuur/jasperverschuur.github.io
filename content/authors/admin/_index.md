      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an assistant professor of Engineering Systems and Climate Security at the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management and the Climate Safety & Security Centre (CaSS) at the TU Delft Campus The Hague, where I lead the Human Security Flagship. I am also a Honorary Research Associate at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford.

I have led climate risk assessment studies in the Netherlands, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, and Jamaica, and regularly advice international organisations such as the World Bank, OECD, EBRD and UK Government on topics related to systemic risk, infrastructure planning and climate. I am a co-founder and geospatial modelling lead of the PortWatch platform (https://portwatch.imf.org), a real-time trade activity monitor of ports and chokepoints globally.
